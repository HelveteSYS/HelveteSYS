## Man.

before you go to our patreon to read our dni, if you are an endo/willow/polymind/non traumagenic "system" dni immediatley, the same if you're profiction/proship/darkship/comship, cope better

we're taken and we don't do the thing that some systems do, where alters can date other people, so we aren't going to date you or your alters to fulfil a ship or some shit

we can be mean sometimes without meaning it, so i am infact sorry if we're rude w/o reason

we're 18, if you're under 15 (15 is thin ice) dni please !

so then you guys dont crucify us, we have:

Autism, DID, BPD, OCD, C-PTSD, symptoms that align with cotard's, and POSSIBLY paranoid schizophrenia, so don't be surprised if we show symptoms of our disorders that we do infact have!

we like a lot of fandoms so like,, i'll list our main ones because theyre SO cool trust.

Postal, Duke Nukem, Hatred (2015), NFRTG, MLP, resident evil, silent hill, and more but they arent as big

warning : Homestuck is thin ice/if we interact first, due it being a special interest, we do have homestuck alters but it is the same, only if they int first can you int with them (if you're trying to be completely friends, that is, also don't rp with us or run up to us if we have a "small fandom" pony you recognize, heavy chances its an alter and you're gonna make them unhappy, whispers are appreciated when interacting for the first time !!!) and we are a recovering hypersexual system so if we make freaky jokes thats why, and ask us to stop if you dislike it!!!
